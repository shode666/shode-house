# separation (scripts/workflow-state.sh), side-effect ledger (scripts/side-effect.sh),
# approval scope + invalidation (scripts/approval.sh). ROADMAP-runtime-10.md Phase 6 /
# 8.3 / 9. Same CI budget rule as every prior milestone (outputs/shode-roadmap/C/
# 05-oliver-decisions.md: "1 AC = 1 test case ในสวีท ไม่ใช่ 1 CI section") -- this is the
# ONE step Milestone D adds to ci.yml, covering all three new scripts in one file.
#
# No framework dependency, same tiny bash test harness as tests/test-workflow-state.sh /
# tests/test-scope-check.sh. Every test runs in its own mktemp -d sandbox via
# WFSTATE_ROOT / SIDEEFFECT_ROOT / APPROVAL_ROOT so tests never touch the real repo state.
