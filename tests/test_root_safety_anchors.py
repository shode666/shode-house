"""Static root-safety-anchor test (v3.17 FR-G-3 AC4 / FR-P9-6 AC1).

Every safety rule that must stay in the ROOT tier has a machine-checked anchor. A split/merge that
drops the line, moves it into a lazy reference (file with a `LOAD:` block), or deletes the map rule
turns this red. Moving a rule = move the anchor text verbatim to another root + update source_of_truth.
