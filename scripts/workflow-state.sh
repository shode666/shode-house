# workflow-state.sh -- Milestone A phase-graph + reconciliation (bd: shode-roadmap/C-A5, iter 2)
#
# Builds on the iter-0/1 tracer bullet (bd: shode-roadmap/C-A4); that history
# is kept in the maintainer implementation notes, which do not ship. This iteration:
#   1. Expands the 6-node MVP graph to the real 10-node shode-house phase set, driven
#      entirely by references/state-machine/transitions.json (states/conditional_phases/
#      enter_requires/transitions) -- no phase or edge name is hardcoded in this script.
#   2. Adds `reconcile <bd-id>` (ROADMAP-runtime-10.md SS2.2, 6 checks).
#
#   workflow-state.sh init <bd-id>
#   workflow-state.sh validate <bd-id>
#   workflow-state.sh advance <bd-id> <phase> [<outcome>]
#   workflow-state.sh reconcile <bd-id>
#
# <outcome> (advance's 3rd, optional arg; default "passed") is the ending status the
# *current* phase (the transition's `from`) receives once this call is accepted:
#   passed    -- default; clean forward move
#   skipped   -- only legal when `from` is in transitions.json's conditional_phases
#   failed    -- for backward/rework edges (e.g. 3b-review -review-fail-> 2-implement)
#   escalated -- special self-transition, see the cmd_advance comment below; not a
#                graph edge, does not need an entry in transitions.json's "transitions"
#
# Deps: bash + jq + shasum + realpath + sync (ADR-C3 -- no python3 in the hot path; shasum already used by
# the maintainer suite test-workflow-state.sh in iter0, so it's an established, CI-verified dependency).
#
# Engagement guard: every command is a no-op (exit 0, silent, no side effect) unless
# "$ROOT/.shode-house" already exists. This script never creates that top-level dir --
# it is assumed created by a separate bootstrap step (/init rule 11, out of this task's
# scope). This is intentional so an unrelated repo that never opted into shode-house
# workflow-state is never touched.
#
# bd is an OPTIONAL MIRROR, not a dependency (maintainer decision record
# #6 / ADR-C6): `reconcile`'s bd-dependent checks (1 and 2) are SKIPPED -- loudly, with a
# printed reason -- when `bd` is not on PATH or there is no active bd workspace. They are
# never silently treated as PASS, and a missing bd never crashes the script.
#
# ROOT can be overridden with WFSTATE_ROOT (used by the test suite to run inside an
# isolated tmp dir instead of the real repo cwd).
