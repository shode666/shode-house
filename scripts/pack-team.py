"""Build a full-team test candidate; maintainer-only, never a runtime dependency.

Does not publish, install, edit source, or certify host compatibility. Existing
artifacts are never overwritten. Stable publication requires separate qualification.

Generated tree = source layout (v4 ADR iter 5 F-4, §5.8; erratum 1 §5.8.1/§5.8.2):
agent files, skill roots and command bodies at the plugin root are the authored file
(frontmatter incl. `model:` kept) with plugin-root and `./`/`../` references re-pointed to
its knowledge/ copy, plus a generated resolution footer. Two generated insertions exist and
nothing else: the style safety floor in the `ask` skill (skills-only hosts) and one pointer
line in every skill neither preloaded nor `ask`.
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/` (and bucketed skill paths) are rewritten to the
tree's `knowledge/` copy, never between floor markers. A `./` or `../` file reference outside
code fences and floor markers is rewritten to the same file's `knowledge/` copy, relative to
where the generated file sits (S2I-1, UD R53). `--check` asserts all of it, and that every
`./`/`../` reference in the tree's Markdown resolves inside the tree (file:line on failure).
Refused (v7u.4.23): a code fence that never closes (S21-2), any `./`/`../` reference (a dotfile
one, a doubled separator or an emphasis-wrapped one included, S23-1/S23-7) in an agent, command or
output style, whose text has no file location (S21-3, R59), a plugin-root or source-root path that
climbs with `..` (S23-9), and any symlink in the tree, on read and on write (S21-1), or above it
inside the repository (S23-2). A source problem is cited at the source file:line with the authored
text. `--tree` writes only into a new or empty directory or an existing shode-house tree (S23-6),
never through a link, hardlink or FIFO planted after its checks (S23-3/S23-4), and refuses a tree
path with a `..` component, so its checks and writes see one directory (S23-8).
