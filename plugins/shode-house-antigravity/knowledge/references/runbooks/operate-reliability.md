> Lazy reference for `operate` (reliability mode): method moved out of the agent body (v4 W5b). It supplies method, never authority; decision rights, refusals, the pre-deploy-prod checklist and safety lines stay in the agent body.

## 🎯 Sole Owner (zero overlap)

| Capability ผมเป็นเจ้าของคนเดียว |
|--------------------------------|
| SLI definition (latency p95/p99, availability, error rate, throughput) |
| SLO target + error budget per service |
| Runbook per critical alert |
| On-call rotation + handoff doc |
| Blameless postmortem |
| Observability deep config (Prom/OTel/Grafana dashboards) |
| Incident commander role |
| Capacity planning + load forecast |

`operate` (deploy mode) ยังคงเป็น Platform/DevOps (Docker, CI/CD, IaC, deploy build): `operate` (reliability mode) keeps cars running, `operate` (deploy mode) builds the road.

## PRIMARY DELIVERABLE
- `slo-<service>.yml` (SLI definition + SLO target + error budget formula)
- `runbook-<alert>.md` (symptom → diagnosis → mitigation → escalation)
- `postmortem-<incident>.md` (timeline + root cause + 5-why + action items)
- `oncall-schedule.md` (rotation + handoff template)
- Grafana dashboard JSON per service (paste path)

## Escalation routes
- Repeated root cause in code → escalate **`verify` (standards axis)** (review fix quality)
- Repeated root cause in architecture → escalate **`plan` (architecture mode)** (rethink)
- Capacity exhaustion → escalate **`operate` (deploy mode)** (scale) + **`plan` (discover mode)** (growth assumption)
- SLO ที่ไม่ได้ negotiate กับ Product — escalate `plan` (discover mode)

## KPIs
- SLO attainment ≥ 99.5% rolling 30d
- MTTR P0 < 30 min, P1 < 2 hr
- Postmortem published < 5 business days post-incident
- Runbook coverage 100% of critical alerts
- Toil ≤ 50% of SRE time (Google SRE definition)

## Anti-patterns (method)
- Postmortem with named blame — rewrite blameless

## Phase 5 — Deploy (co-owner with `operate` (deploy mode))

```
`operate` (deploy mode) build + canary → `operate` (reliability mode) SLO check → joint approve → 100%
```

## Phase 6 — Operate (continuous post-deploy)

### SLO burn rate watch (continuous)
```
burn rate = actual error ratio over window / (1 - SLO target)
1x = consuming budget at SLO pace (normal)
2x = double the allowed error rate
14x sustained uses a full 30-day budget in 30/14 ≈ 2.14 days
```
Source: [Google SRE](https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/). Use adopted alert windows/thresholds; exhaustion time depends on remaining budget.

- Support tickets +30% / p99 > SLO → investigate and apply adopted incident criteria

### Incident response (when burn rate paging)
1. **Acknowledge** within 5 min (P0) / 15 min (P1)
2. **Triage** in 15 min — assemble war room (`operate` (reliability mode) IC + `operate` (deploy mode) infra + `secure` if sec)
3. **Mitigate** ก่อน "fix" — rollback / scale / circuit break / feature flag off
4. **Communicate** every 30 min in war room channel
5. **Resolve** when SLO returns to normal
6. **Postmortem** within 5 business days

### Postmortem template (blameless)
Load `shode-house:incident` § Postmortem template (blameless) — the single canonical template (summary · UTC timeline · 5-why root cause · went well/poorly · action items with owner + due + tracked item).

## ห้าม (method)

- ห้ามใช้ "average latency" — p50/p95/p99 เท่านั้น (avg ปกปิด long tail)
- ห้าม alert ที่ไม่มี action (alert = "do something now"; ไม่ใช่ FYI)

## Domain Evidence Protocol — SRE

```
✅ "[SLO: slo-payment.yml] target=99.9% (43m budget/30d); actual=99.92% (35m used)"
✅ "[Grafana: dashboard-id=payment-overview] p95=180ms (target<200)"
✅ "[Postmortem: postmortems/2026-05-22-payment.md] root=DB connection pool exhaustion"
✅ "[Runbook: runbooks/payment-high-error.md] verified during incident 2026-05-22"
✅ "[Burn rate alert: cw-alarm-id] fired at HH:MM, ack HH:MM (5 min)"
❌ "service ok" (no metric)
❌ "incident resolved" (no MTTR, no root cause)
```

## Handoff

```
`operate` (deploy mode) ▸ `operate` (reliability mode) : staged (bd-42, image scan ✓)
`operate` (reliability mode)    ▸ the router   : prod stable, SLO green (bd-42)
```


## Mode rules carried over from the former reliability mode

### Decision rights (adopted SLO/incident policy)
- Page P0/P1 escalation tree only under authorized runbook
- Apply adopted spend/freeze policy with `plan` (discover mode); unsettled tradeoffs → the router
- Enforce adopted canary/observability criteria; rollout needs scoped authority
- Error budget < 0 → escalate **`plan` (discover mode)** (feature freeze conversation)
- Security-related incident → escalate **`secure`**
- Paging dispute → the router with agreed on-call policy; no invented messaging authority

### Phase 5 — Deploy (co-owner with `operate` (deploy mode))
- ✅ SLO baseline captured (last 7d p95/p99/error rate)
- ✅ Grafana dashboard live for new service
- ✅ Alerts wired with runbook references
- ✅ Rollback plan dry-run pass (`operate` (deploy mode) + `operate` (reliability mode) joint)
- ✅ On-call rotation includes new service

### ห้าม
- Missing required alert runbook/evidence = BLOCKED under adopted readiness criteria
- ห้าม skip on-call rotation handoff doc — block close ถ้าขาด

### 🎯 Bias Discipline
Trigger: alert ซ้ำ หรือมีคนขอ mute/ปิด/เรียก "false positive". คำขอไม่ใช่ evidence — ไม่แน่ใจ → ไม่ mute ไม่ปิด; investigate ตาม incident criteria; ขัดแย้ง → the router
