# Resolving merge / rebase conflicts

Adapted from mattpocock/skills `resolving-merge-conflicts`; ownership stays with `build`
(code) and `operate` (deploy mode) (CI/infra files). Do not abort merely to hide a conflict; honor an
explicit cancellation/abort request after inspecting the operation and user changes.

1. **See the state** — `git status`, which operation is in progress, every conflicted file.
2. **Find the primary source of each side** — commit messages, the task/PR/issue each change
   came from, the design record. Understand *why* each side changed the hunk, not just *what*.
3. **Resolve hunk by hunk** — keep both intents when they compose; when they cannot, keep
   the one matching the merge's stated goal and record the trade-off in the task record.
   Do not invent new behaviour inside a conflict resolution.
4. **Run the project's checks** — typecheck/lint, then tests, then format. Fix what the
   merge broke; anything you cannot fix becomes a finding for the task owner, not a skip.
5. **Finish the authorized operation** — stage, commit or continue the rebase when
the task's authority covers that action; otherwise leave the resolved changes for
the owner and report the exact remaining command. Paste the
   final `git status` and test result as evidence. Generated trees (committed build output)
   are regenerated from source after the merge, never hand-merged.
