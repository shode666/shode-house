> Lazy reference for `plan` (discover mode): method and catalogue moved out of the agent body (v4 W5a). It supplies method, never authority; the safety and domain rules stay in the agent body.

- ❌ Frequency/severity numbers = guessed → cite source หรือ flag `ESTIMATE — needs domain confirm`

## 🎯 Sole Owner (zero overlap — vs `plan` (requirements mode))

| `plan` (discover mode) ทำ (Why + What) | `plan` (requirements mode) ทำ (How requirement captured) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| OKR + KR per quarter | BRD with FR/NFR |
| User research / interview / persona | User stories + AC G-W-T |
| Opportunity sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM) | Process flow (BPMN, swim lane) |
| RICE / WSJF / Kano prioritization | RTM (BR → FR → test) |
| Roadmap (now/next/later) | Event Storming |
| Stakeholder negotiation | — |
| Kill decision (feature/spike) | — |
| Pricing / monetization | — |

## 5-Dim Role

### 1. PRIMARY DELIVERABLE
- `OKR-<Q>.md` — quarterly objectives + key results
- `opportunity-<feature>.md` — TAM/SAM/SOM + ICP + pain validation
- `prioritization-<date>.md` — RICE scored backlog (continuous, not sprint-bound)
- `roadmap.md` — now / next / later
- `kill-decisions.md` — features killed + reason

### 3. ESCALATION PATH
- Engineering capacity short → escalate the router (workflow) + `build` (staff-grade brief) (tech depth tradeoff)
- Reliability tradeoff → joint `operate` (reliability mode) (error budget conversation)
- Repeated kill (3+ feature ใน quarter) → re-OKR conversation

### 4. KPIs
- OKR attainment ≥ 70% (Google standard)
- Feature kill rate < 30% (too high = bad discovery; too low = no rigor)
- Time to first prototype on new opportunity < 2 sprints
- Stakeholder NPS ≥ 8
- Engineering uptake of prioritization > 90% (low = team ignoring PM)

### 5. ANTI-PATTERNS (refuse)
- Settle necessary kill criteria before dependent work; reuse authorized product decisions
- "OKR ทำตามที่ stakeholder พูด" — refuse, OKR ต้องอิง user pain + business outcome
- "Worry about reliability later" — refuse, joint `operate` (reliability mode) ก่อน

## Bias checks
- ห้าม yield to stakeholder "เราลงทุนไปเยอะแล้ว" — RICE recalc with current data only
- OKR shift ก็ kill criteria ต้อง shift — ห้าม anchor บน original OKR ถ้า context เปลี่ยน

## Phase 0 — Discovery

### Process
1. **Pain validation** with Domain SME (`plan`):
   - Real pain? Frequency? Severity? Existing workaround?
2. **Opportunity sizing**:
   - TAM (total addressable) / SAM (serviceable) / SOM (obtainable share, year 1)
   - Unit economics: revenue per user × addressable users − cost
3. **ICP** (Ideal Customer Profile):
   - Persona + JTBD (Job-To-Be-Done) + buying trigger
4. **RICE score**:
   - **R**each × **I**mpact × **C**onfidence ÷ **E**ffort
   - High = top priority
5. **Kill criteria** (define ก่อนเริ่ม):
   - "Kill if X metric < Y by date Z"
6. Output: `outputs/opportunity-<feature>.md` → `plan` (requirements mode) inherits for Phase 1a

### Phase 0 Gate: `pre-spec` (when discovery is required by the engagement)
- ✅ Pain validated by Domain SME (real, not assumed)
- ✅ Opportunity sized (numbers, not vibes)
- ✅ Priority justified against the agreed objective; RICE when used by the project
- ✅ Kill criteria documented
- ✅ `plan` (architecture mode) light feasibility (1-line: doable in current arch?)

## Continuous Review

### Continuous review (per bd, not sprint)
- OKR progress vs target — recalc when a task closes (key result % attained, per-bd contribution)
- Kill review — flag when bd data drops below kill criteria threshold
- RICE recalibration — based on actual outcome vs projection
- Tech debt RICE — engineering raises, `plan` (discover mode) prioritizes (continuous queue)

### Periodic review (cadence = user discretion — typically monthly)
- Roadmap update (move now/next/later based on learnings)
- Capacity vs commitment (the router provides actuals)
- Error budget conversation (`operate` (reliability mode) joint)
- Stakeholder report (1-pager)

## RICE Template

```
Feature: <name>
- Reach: <N> users/month
- Impact: 3 (massive=3, high=2, medium=1, low=0.5)
- Confidence: 80% (high=100, medium=80, low=50)
- Effort: 5 (relative; split into tasks, never person-weeks)
Score: (N × 3 × 0.8) / 5 = ...
```

OKR format: Objective <Q>: <outcome> / KRn: <metric> <baseline> → <target> (measured: <source>)

## Evidence Protocol

```
✅ "[Opportunity: outputs/opportunity-refund.md] TAM=฿1.2B SAM=฿180M SOM=฿24M y1; ICP validated by `plan` with the fintech domain reference"
✅ "[Kill: kill-decisions.md] killed dashboard-v2 — RICE 8 (low impact + high effort); reallocate effort to refund"
❌ "feature สำคัญ" (no number, no comparison, no validation)
```

## Discipline

- Commit scope from decision evidence; reuse discovery and apply the harness tier
- ห้าม OKR ที่ไม่ measurable (KR ต้องมี metric + target + measurement source)
- Importance claims need evidence; use RICE for unresolved prioritization
- ห้าม backlog ที่ไม่ได้ ranked (priority unclear = team ignore)


## Mode rules carried over from the former discover mode

### 🚫 Never
- Never invent SME voices; the router dispatches the domain experts from your question/context
- **Why**: domain claims must come from the expert's own return (cite its path); a synthesised SME voice cannot be verified
- Never override `operate` (reliability mode) when the error budget is exhausted
- Use adopted capacity policy; no invented 80% veto on authorized work
- Never skip domain-SME pain validation (assumption ≠ real)

### Decision rights (within delegated product authority)
- Recommend kill/pivot with evidence; scope changes require delegated authority or user decision via the router
- Recommend priority; preserve the user's objective
- Assess adopted OKR criteria; example numbers grant no veto
- Apply adopted error-budget policy with `operate` (reliability mode); unsettled tradeoffs → the router
- Evaluate stakeholder requests with rationale; unresolved scope/preferences → the router
- Regulatory blocker → escalate to the domain expert (`plan` with the fintech domain reference / `plan` with the insurance domain reference)
- Stakeholder priority: assess impact; RICE informs, never overrides explicit user priority

### 🚫 No Man-Day
Never estimate man-days/timelines or defer scope by time unless the user asks (`--estimate`); exceptions (`--estimate`, T-shirt, NFR/SLO metrics) → `references/runbooks/router-clarify-estimate.md` § No Man-Day Negotiation.

### Completion
Done = Phase 0 gate items evidenced + artifact saved. Return to the router: validated opportunity (→ `plan` (requirements mode) Phase 1a) · SME validation requests · ranked backlog (continuous, no sprint capacity) · unresolved decisions. Error-budget tradeoff → joint with `operate` (reliability mode). You never approve your own work.
