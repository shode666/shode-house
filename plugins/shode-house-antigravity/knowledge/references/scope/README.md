# references/scope/ -- machine-checkable scope lock (Milestone E)

Applicability: this is documentation for the separate script runtime, only for
projects that explicitly adopted it and verified its tools/hooks. The distributed
instruction-only plugin does not supply or implicitly install that runtime. Without
it, use scoped ownership and serialized writes under the harness; do not claim
script enforcement from this reference alone.

> bd: shode-roadmap/C-E1 · maintainer runtime roadmap SS7 (Concurrency Safety) 7.1-7.3 (that document does not ship)
> Read by `scripts/scope-check.sh` and humans only -- never preloaded into an agent
> context (no `agents/**` file and no preloaded skill points at this directory).

## Relationship to `references/scope-lock.md` (do not confuse the two)

`references/scope-lock.md` is the existing **text protocol**: an implementing agent
posts a "Scope Contract" chat message (`IN/OUT/Files/Stop/Echo`) and the router enforces
overlap by reading that message. It works, but it is only as strong as every agent
remembering to post it and the router remembering to scan for overlap -- nothing stops a
write if either step is skipped (exactly what happened in this session: three agents
were told to scope-lock by brief text alone, no script backed it up).

This directory is the **script-checkable layer underneath that same discipline**:

| | `scope-lock.md` | `references/scope/` (this dir) |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | prose protocol + template | JSON Schema + example + `scripts/scope-check.sh` |
| Enforced by | agent/router reading a chat message | a script any agent, hook, or CI step can call |
| Source of truth for "Files:" | the posted Scope Contract text | a manifest translated from that same text |
| Adds | IN/OUT/Echo (human-facing scope discipline) | shared-file strategy + optimistic conflict check (7.2/7.3, not covered by scope-lock.md at all) |

They are meant to compose, not duplicate: an agent still posts the Scope Contract
(scope-lock.md, unchanged), and whoever owns the manifest for a bd (the router, or an
`/init`-time bootstrap step -- out of this milestone's scope) mirrors the `Files:`
field into a manifest under `.shode-house/scope/<bd-id>.json` so it becomes checkable
by script instead of by re-reading chat history.

## Files here

- `manifest.schema.json` -- JSON Schema for the manifest `scripts/scope-check.sh` reads
  (`.shode-house/scope/<bd-id with / -> -->.json` inside a project, NOT this directory).
- `example.manifest.json` -- a worked example, deliberately modeled on this very
  session's three parallel agents plus the real `ci.yml` / `golden.json`
  incident (commit `ac632a3`) via `shared_files["...ci.yml"].coupled_with`.

## Using the script

```bash
scripts/scope-check.sh <bd-id> <agent> <path>              # 7.1+7.2 ownership check
scripts/scope-check.sh <bd-id> <agent> <path> --snapshot    # 7.3 record base sha
scripts/scope-check.sh <bd-id> <agent> <path> --verify      # 7.3 optimistic conflict check
```

Exit codes: `0` ALLOW · `1` DENY · `2` NO_MANIFEST · `3` CONFLICT (`--verify` only) ·
`64` usage/dependency error. If `.shode-house/` does not exist at all, every command
exits `0` with **no stdout** (engagement guard, same convention as
`scripts/workflow-state.sh`) -- this repo/session never opted in, so the script must
never block a plain `git status`-clean checkout.

Full exit-code contract + shared-file mode semantics are documented as comments in
`scripts/scope-check.sh` itself (single source of truth for behavior; this file is the
narrative index only).
