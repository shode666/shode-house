# `plan` (requirements mode) — producer runbook (Phase 0/1a)

> ย้ายจาก `agents/plan.md` (bd:shode-roadmap/C-G1) — branch review/spec-axis ไม่ใช้ section เหล่านี้

## Event Storming (DDD)

Sticky color:
- 🟧 Domain Event (past tense): "Order Placed"
- 🟦 Command (intent): "Place Order"
- 🟨 Actor/Role
- 🟩 Aggregate (consistency boundary)
- 🟪 Policy/Rule
- 🟥 Hotspot (ไม่แน่ใจ)
- 🟫 External System

Flow: Big Picture (event timeline) → Process (add command + actor) → Design (aggregate + bounded context)

Output: timeline, bounded context map, ubiquitous language, hotspots → `plan` (architecture mode)+Domain

Ubiquitous language lands in the project's `CONTEXT.md` (glossary only; format and
ownership per `shode-house-workflow/harness.md` § Source of truth and host capabilities) — update it the
moment a term is resolved, not in a batch at the end.

## RTM via the confirmed source of truth

Use the mapping confirmed on first project engagement, Markdown fallback. These
CLI examples apply only when that tracker is selected, available and writes are
authorized; inspect its supported commands before use. They are not setup steps.
```bash
create task "BR-01: refund ภายใน 3 วัน" (type business-req)
create task "FR-101: POST /refund" (blocked by BR-01)
create task "TC-33: refund happy path" (type test, blocked by FR-101)
render the dependency graph (tracker view or Mermaid)
```

GitHub: `gh issue create -t "BR-01: ..." -l business-req,p1`
Linear: `linear issue create -t "BR-01: ..." -p urgent`
Jira: ใช้ Atlassian MCP (`createJiraIssue`)

**Universal rules** (ตาม `shode-house-workflow` § Task Tracking — tracker abstraction):
- BR → ≥1 FR → ≥1 test (link via blocked-by/parent-child)
- Orphan: FR ไม่มี BR = scope creep; BR ไม่มี test = untested
- Keep status/dependencies in the confirmed canonical home, including Markdown
  when selected. Link deliverables; do not create a competing task database.

## Process

1. Discover missing stakeholder/scope/constraint/success decisions; no question quota.
2. Validate against settled evidence; route consequential unresolved decisions through the router.
3. Event Storming (complex domain) → bounded context
4. BRD/FRD/Stories
5. RTM linking in the canonical record
6. Gap & risk

## Output Format (BRD)

```markdown
# BRD: [name]

## Executive Summary
## Business Objective (SMART)
## Stakeholders (RACI)
## Scope (in / out)
## Functional Requirements
- FR-001: [Priority] [Description]
  - AC: Given ... When ... Then ...
## NFR (refer `plan` (architecture mode))
## Process Flow (Mermaid as-is + to-be)
## Event Storm + Bounded Context + Glossary
