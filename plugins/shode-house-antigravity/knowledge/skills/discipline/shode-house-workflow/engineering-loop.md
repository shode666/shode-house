# Engineering loop inside the team

Read for design, implementation or diagnosis; not for greetings or routine status.
This refines existing role ownership, not a second workflow or replacement team.

## Resolve uncertainty before expanding work

`plan` (requirements mode) records observable acceptance and shared business vocabulary. Inspect project
facts first. The router routes technical uncertainty to `plan`/`build` or the relevant domain
expert; only unresolved policy, scope or authority goes to the user. Ask the current
decision frontier together, with alternatives and a recommendation. Do not ask a
dependent question before its prerequisite is settled. Reuse recorded decisions;
do not turn every continuation into another approval ceremony.

## Deliver vertical, testable increments

`plan` (architecture mode) and `build` choose a thin end-to-end slice that exercises the risky boundary,
then decompose remaining work by dependency and verifiable outcome. Each slice has
one owner, acceptance and a test seam. Do not split by arbitrary file counts or
build every abstraction before a working behavior exists. Domain experts preserve
business invariants; `secure` preserves security and transaction boundaries.

`build` uses red-green-refactor for changed behavior: establish an intended failure,
make the smallest correct implementation, then refactor with checks green. Read
existing tests first. A recorded matching reproduction can establish the red step;
do not rerun merely to manufacture ceremony. Expected results must come from the
contract or independently derived examples, not a copy of the implementation.
Prefer public-behavior tests; mock genuine external boundaries, not every internal
method. Keep meaningful integration checks where mocks could hide a broken contract.

## Diagnose with falsifiable hypotheses

For a diagnosis request, reproduce or collect relevant evidence, form a bounded
hypothesis, choose a discriminating check, and revise from the result. Do not make
an unrequested fix. For an authorized fix, add the regression and verify neighboring
behavior. An unchanged failure requires a new hypothesis/evidence, not blind retries
or a full pipeline reset. Record environmental limits as BLOCKED, never green.

## Review without overlap or overengineering

`plan` (requirements mode) verifies requirement conformity; `verify` (standards axis) checks internal behavior, invariants,
error paths and maintainability; `verify` (runtime axis) checks integration and user journeys. Link
the same defect under one finding ID across axes. Keep independent review contexts
and preserve dissent rather than counting duplicate findings as extra assurance.

`verify` (standards axis) and `plan` (architecture mode) challenge each new abstraction: what current responsibility or
variation requires it, and what simpler application-layer design satisfies the
same contract? Prefer cohesive modules with small interfaces. Apply SRP by reason
to change, not one class per line of logic. Reject speculative frameworks, empty
pass-through layers and generic engines with no demonstrated need. Do not remove
required authorization, transaction, audit or isolation boundaries for simplicity.

## Spend context on decisions

For bounded work, use one task record with linked sections: `plan` (requirements mode)'s acceptance,
`plan` (architecture mode)'s consequential decisions, `build`'s implementation and each reviewer's evidence.
An existing approved contract can be linked instead of rewritten. Full BRD/ADR
documents are warranted by unresolved scope or consequential design, not phase
labels. Sharing an artifact does not combine authorship or independent verdicts;
serialize edits to shared files and preserve disagreements.

Each verification records the finding/criterion ID, source revision or content
hash, affected contract/dependencies, test command/environment, result and owner.
After a fix, the finding owner rechecks it; the router routes affected boundaries to
their reviewers. Unchanged evidence is reusable only when those inputs still match.
Changed acceptance goes to `plan` (requirements mode); changed security/domain constraints go to their
owners. Unknown impact requires investigation, not blanket reuse or a full reset.

Keep shared terms and consequential ADRs in the confirmed record home. Load only
the affected expert knowledge; retain the complete knowledge in the distribution.
Send artifact deltas, evidence locations and unresolved questions, not transcripts.
Never trim acceptance, approvals, domain constraints or UNKNOWN operations to fit
a token budget. Measure actual usage when the host exposes it; label byte counts
as bytes, not token savings or quality proof.

decision questioning, feedback loops and deep modules). These are applied through
Shode House's existing specialists, harness and verification ownership.
