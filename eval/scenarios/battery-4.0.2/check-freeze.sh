# 4.0.2 routing-probe battery (P01..P47 mapped to the same 6 types) -- its own manifest, independent of eval/FREEZE.sha256,
# eval/scenarios/core-4.0/FREEZE.sha256 and eval/shape-baseline/FREEZE.sha256. Those are the historical baseline and are never edited;
# this battery is DERIVED from the frozen eval/scenarios/golden.json by the one stated rule below, and the check re-derives it every time.
#   bash eval/scenarios/battery-4.0.2/check-freeze.sh            verify manifest + derivation (exit 0 = OK)
#   bash eval/scenarios/battery-4.0.2/check-freeze.sh --update   re-derive battery-4.0.2.json and rewrite the manifest
#                                                               (a new revision of this battery: disclose it; only before a run)
# Rule: copy every `kind: probe` scenario of golden.json in order (same id, prompt file, max_turns, class, desc, source, fixture_flags,
# related, not_applicable, and every expected field except the agent ids). In `expected.route_any` (agent:<id>) and
# `expected.must_not_dispatch` rewrite each 4.0.0 agent id to its 4.0.1 type (TYPE below; the 7 domain ids and the `*-expert` glob -> plan;
# `orchestrator` is the router itself, not a spawn type, and is dropped). A list keeps its order and loses duplicates. A type that the
# probe REQUIRES (route_any) is removed from its must_not_dispatch (two 4.0.0 ids that are now one type cannot be required and forbidden
# at once); the removed names are recorded in `dropped_4_0_1`. Added per probe: `type_4_0_1` (first required type, or "-" for a
# skill-only route), `mode_4_0_1` (MODE below: the mode or review axis that owns it) and, for the 7 single-domain probes,
# `domain_4_0_1` (scored by check-domain.py: the plan spawn names that domain's reference and the pinned model tier). The sha256 of the
# source is recorded in the battery and must match. Prompts (eval/prompts/probes/*.md) are the baseline's, pinned by eval/FREEZE.sha256.
