"""Post-run redaction of DERIVED evidence for eval/run-core.sh (UD U23, OD-2 option A+).

The frozen writers (eval/run-lib.sh `run_one` / `tools_seen`, scripts/team-run-check.py) copy raw run text into the
files a person reads and pastes. They are frozen (eval/FREEZE.sha256), so the redaction runs after them, here, with
the one redaction step the eval scorers share (eval/evidence_redact.py). What is redacted and what is not:

  derived (redacted in place): tools-seen.txt, score.txt, score.json, meta.json -- every file run_one computes FROM
      the run (meta.json carries first_skill / first_agent / route / model_id copied out of the trace)
  raw (never touched, local only): run.jsonl (the scorer's input; its sha256 is recorded before and checked after),
      run.files (also a scorer input), run.diff, run.stderr, prompt.txt, fixture.*, probe-settings.json

Every replacement is atomic: the redacted copy is written to a temporary file in the same directory (mode 0600),
flushed and fsync'd, then renamed over the original (os.replace = rename(2), the same operation as `mv -f` within
one file system); a failure removes the temporary file and leaves the original as it was. A file whose redaction
changes nothing is not rewritten. JSON files are parsed and only string VALUES are redacted (`redact_tree`), so a
status, verdict, count or exit code is never changed; a JSON file that does not parse is redacted as text. In
tools-seen.txt the JSON of each first-input line is parsed too, and a value the frozen writer cut at 300 characters
(it appends "...") is redacted as if the cut were the end of the string (`redact_tools_seen`).

Commands (exit 0 = done; any other exit = redaction failed, the caller must stop -- fail-closed):
  redact_derived.py selftest            the helper and eval/evidence_redact.py load and redact a known shape
  redact_derived.py seal <run-dir>      redact the derived files of one run and write <run-dir>/redaction.json
  redact_derived.py file <path>         redact one text file in place (the runner's buffered console output)
  redact_derived.py text                stdin -> stdout (a SUMMARY.tsv row, a console line)
  redact_derived.py lockdown <out-dir>  before any run: every dir 0700, every file 0600, or refuse (see `lockdown`)
A failure message names the file and the error type only, never file content.
