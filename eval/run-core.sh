# Core matrix: live runs of the core scenarios, sequential, every run kept. This script records; it does not judge.
# The set follows the plugin major (eval/core-set.sh): 3.x = E01 from golden.json + E02..E15, E10b, E1c from
# eval/scenarios/core-3.17.json (frozen); 4.0.0 = all 17 from eval/scenarios/core-4.0/core-4.0.json (its own freeze); 4.0.1+ = the same 17 for the 6 agent types from eval/scenarios/core-4.0.1/core-4.0.1.json (its own freeze).
#   bash eval/run-core.sh [model=sonnet] [out-dir]          (run on the Mac, from anywhere)
#   CORE_IDS="E02 E10b" | all     default all (17 ids)
#   CLAUDE_BIN / PLUGIN_REF / RUN_TIMEOUT_S / MAX_BUDGET_USD: as in eval/run-lib.sh
# layout : <out>/<id>/{run.jsonl,run.files,run.diff,meta.json,score.txt,score.json,tools-seen.txt,prompt.txt,
#          fixture.log,fixture.sha,fixture-core.sha256} · <out>/SUMMARY.tsv (append-only, row per run) · <out>/log.txt
# resume : re-invoke with the SAME out-dir. A complete run (success / error_max_turns) is skipped: never overwritten,
#          never retried (a scored FAIL is data). A crashed run (no result) is kept and the id re-run into
#          <id>.retry<n>. An INFRA result (429, credits, budget, error_during_execution) is kept, never counted,
#          and stops the batch (exit 5): wait, then re-invoke the same command.
# exit   : 0 every id has a scored run (PASS or FAIL) · 2 some id unscorable/incomplete · 3 refused · 5 stopped (infra)
#          · 4 stopped: redaction failed (fail-closed), or an out-dir that cannot be made owner-only · 129/130/143
#          interrupted (HUP/INT/TERM)
# redact : (UD U23 OD-2 A+) umask 077 for everything this batch writes (dirs 0700, files 0600); an existing out-dir is
#          tightened to the same modes before any run (redact_derived.py lockdown; symlink or odd entry = exit 4). After run_one, the
#          derived files of the run (tools-seen.txt, score.txt, score.json, meta.json) are redacted in place,
#          atomically, by eval/redact_derived.py (eval/evidence_redact.py rules); run.jsonl stays byte-exact (its
#          sha256 is recorded in <run>/redaction.json and checked) and local-only, as do run.files/run.diff/run.stderr.
#          run_one's console output is buffered in <out>/.redact-pending.out and printed only after redaction; the
#          SUMMARY.tsv row and every line built from run text pass through the redactor first. Any redaction failure
#          stops the batch with exit 4: no further run, no row, no summary line.
# isolate: run_one runs as a background job whose stdout/stderr is the buffer and which holds no other descriptor of
#          the runner (no console, no log.txt): nothing it starts (claude, the model's commands, git, the scorer) can
#          write past the redactor through an inherited descriptor (Sentinel final F3). That is all it covers: a process
#          of the same user can still open /dev/tty, or write a file under the out-dir by its path. The runner waits for
#          it; FIRST_ROUTE / SECONDS_TAKEN are read back from the run's meta.json after the redaction.
# interrupt: <out>/.redact-pending names the run in flight from before run_one until its redaction has succeeded.
#          INT/TERM/HUP, to the runner or to its whole process group -> the run in flight is stopped (the job and its
#          direct children get TERM), best-effort redaction of that run, a "NOT final" line on the console (straight
#          into log.txt when the console is already gone: SIGPIPE is ignored), exit 129/130/143, marker kept. The
#          next invocation with the same out-dir (also after a kill -9) redacts that run again before anything else,
#          clears the marker and prints the redacted buffered output; no SUMMARY row is backfilled (as for any crash, a
#          complete run is then "kept", an incomplete one re-runs into <id>.retry<n>). A run dir without
#          redaction.json, or named in .redact-pending, is not final: never read or paste from it.
# All run/score/evidence logic is eval/run-lib.sh `run_one` (frozen), reused as is. run_one has no hook for the
# fixture script, so the one call it makes to scripts/eval-fixture.sh is redirected below to
# scripts/eval-fixture-core.sh (which itself calls the frozen script, then adds the scenario's assets).
umask 077   # before any file or directory of the batch exists (OD-2 A+): raw and derived evidence stay owner-only
